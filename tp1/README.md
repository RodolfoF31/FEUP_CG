    - Representing the object in the 2D axis was straightforward.
    - To represent the object on both sides, we simply needed to reverse the order in which the triangles are drawn ((0,1,2) to (2,1,0)).

    - We didn't have much difficulty because it was pretty much the same thing as the previous exercise.
